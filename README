The program is copyright of the Harvard CS50 professor David, I implemented the init, move, draw, and won functions. Aslo I created the correct makefile for the program.
*Instructions for running program*

To change the board to desired NxN go into the makefile(line 8) and change the number 3 to any n from 3-9.
Example: 
	./$(NAME) 3
For 5x5 board
	./$(NAME) 5

To put the solution for the board in the makefile do
	
	./$(NAME) N NxN.txt

	where 2 < N < 10
