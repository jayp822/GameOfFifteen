1. Besides 4x4, what other dimensions does the framework allow?
	The framework allows for any dimension of the
	gameboard as long as it is in the form NxN
	while 2 < N < 10.
2. What data structure is used for representation of the game board?
	The data structure used is a 2 dimensional array.
3. What function is called to greet the player?
	greet();
4. What functions do you need to implement?
	init, draw, move, won

*Instructions for running program*

To change the board to desired NxN go into the makefile(line 8) and change the number 3 to any n from 3-9.
Example: 
	./$(NAME) 3
For 5x5 board
	./$(NAME) 5

To put the solution for the board in the makefile do
	
	./$(NAME) N NxN.txt

	where 2 < N < 10
